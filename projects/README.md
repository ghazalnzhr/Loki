# SRF projects

## Project-01

Using a button, we count the number of pushes and multiply it by 10.

`distance = buttonPushCount * scale`

The robot travels the distance and then stops.

## Project-02

Put the robot in a distance `x` from the wall. The robot should travel until getting to distance `x - 20` and turn 180 degrees. Then, comes back to the spot in started at.

## Components

- LCD I2C
- L298n motor driver
- SRF
